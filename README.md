Hey guys, 
This repository is literally just a place for me to keep my files where I can access them remotely from a device other than my computer. Also, it is a helpful tool while trying to version control during a project. 

Probably when I start getting more knowledgable and confident in this project, I will create a better github acount and documentation of my process (maybe through YouTube videos :)).
